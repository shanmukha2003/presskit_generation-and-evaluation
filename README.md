# üì∞ AI-Powered Press Kit Generation & Evaluation  

This project presents an AI-driven system for generating and evaluating press kits with minimal manual effort. It leverages a LLaMA 3 model, downloaded from LM Studio, to produce professional-quality content based on user inputs. The system also provides actionable feedback to improve the generated content, ensuring that the final press kit meets the desired quality standards.

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement  

Creating press kits manually is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent. Traditional processes require domain experts to gather information, craft narratives, and refine content repeatedly. The goal of this project is to build an AI-assisted solution that:  

- **Simplifies Press Kit Creation**: Users provide key inputs, and the system generates draft content automatically.  
- **Ensures Content Quality**: Evaluates generated content and suggests improvements.  
- **Improves Efficiency**: Reduces the time and effort required for content creation.  
- **Allows Dynamic Adjustments**: Users can modify content priorities and model parameters if unsatisfied with the output.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality  

The system follows a structured pipeline:  

1. **User Input Collection**:  
   - Users provide relevant details such as event information, target audience, and key messages.  

2. **Priority Adjustment**:  
   - Users can modify the relative importance of different content elements.  

3. **Press Kit Generation**:  
   - The LLaMA 3 model generates draft content based on the provided inputs and adjusted priorities.  

4. **Content Evaluation**:  
   - The system analyzes the generated text, providing feedback on readability, clarity, and relevance.  

5. **Model Adjustments**:  
   - If needed, users can adjust model settings for better results.
